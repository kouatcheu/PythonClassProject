Hi,
  I am excited to use the python skills I have gained through this class to analyze and create visualizations of the clinical data I have been working with in my research laboratory. 
  My Lab project is focused on identifying thyroid nodules in Xeroderma Pigmentosum patients.I have the data of all the patients who received a thyroid ultrascan and identified those who had abnormal thyroid findings. 
  In this project, I will create graphs that show the ages of patients who had thyroid nodules and the number of thyroid nodules that each patient had.
